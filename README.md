# **Welcome to UTC Engine's page!**
"UTC Engine", aka "UNDERTALE CYAN's Engine", etc. Is a open source (with no commercial use) UNDERTALE themed Engine/framework.

It's recommended for those who are willing to make UNDERTALE Soul projects, such as [UNDERTALE YELLOW](https://gamejolt.com/games/UndertaleYellow/136925) or (self indulgent plug here...) [UNDERTALE CYAN!](https://gamejolt.com/games/undertalechopper/922314) (Although it *might* be possible to create any other AUs within this engine, just be warned that it wasn't tested for that.)

# **FRAMEWORK DIFFERENCES**
This framework was built with the goal of staying somewhat accurate with UNDERTALE's gameplay while having some original diferences here and there. 
The listed differences between this framework and the original UNDERTALE's framework are, as follows:

### **Different Game Engines:**

This framework was built for **Gamemaker Studio 2**, not **Gamemaker Studio 1** (The one the actual UNDERTALE was built upon on), due to personal preferences. You *won't* be able to make *32bit* builds of your fan games, though.

### **More QoL Features:**

This framework provides more settings compared to UNDERTALE's, most of them are for the sake of acessibility (and are also toggable!).
Examples:

- New SETTINGS MENU (UTC ENGINE (Example: UNDERTALE CYAN) / ORIGINAL UNDERTALE):

- You can hold the MENU [C] Button to jump and skip dialogues, similar to how DELTARUNE does.
- You can RUN by holding the CANCEL/RUN [X] Button, you can also set-up AUTO-RUN if that's what you prefer.
- (FOR FUN) Toggable LIGHT MODE option, to change the protagonist SOUL color tone. (Example: UNDERTALE CYAN):

### **NOT 1:1 Japanese font**:

This framework also features language support, although it has some flaws if we are talking about the JAPANESE Font.
All of the fonts in this Engine were made using Gamemaker 2's bitmap fonts feature, so it doesn't support kerning on fonts.
- You can see the difference between these 2 screenshots from the instructions menu, from UTC and UT respectively:

The difference is so small, you might not even notice at first glance.
If this doesn't concern you, then... uhm... You just learned something!

# And that's all!

We hope you like this engine, and it will be an honor to see it as your way of learning making UNDERTALE fan-games, or even just finishing one in general...

Oh, but wait! we are not done yet.
